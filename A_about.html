<p>I'm Angus.  I'm a smart guy who can learn stuff quickly (technical or otherwise).

I have an undergraduate degree in physics and a masters degree in applied computing.

Since graduating I have been working in the topsy-turvy world of academic research, mostly doing systems and devops type stuff.</p>
